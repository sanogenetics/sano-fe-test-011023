# Sano Genetics Frontend Engineer task

⚠️ Please, **do not fork this repository**. Doing so, could invalidate your test.⚠️

The goal of this task is to introduce you to some of the technologies that we use at Sano, and give you an indication on responsibilities of the role.

In this test, you will display a list of studies and be able to leave/join any study. The list of studies should look beautiful, be accessible and mobile friendly.

# Technologies:
This project includes the following FE technologies which are the most common ones we use at Sano:
- <a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html" target="_blank">Vue.JS</a>
- <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass for styling</a>
- <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">Typescript</a>
- <a href="https://www.cypress.io/" target="_blank">Cypress</a> (E2E testing)

Please complete this test using Vue.JS, Typescript, TailwindCSS, SCSS and Cypress. Do not add any third party libraries.
